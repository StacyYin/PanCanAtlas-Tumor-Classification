# PanCanAtlas-Tumor-Classification
- Applied Keras LSTM to do tumor classification in RNA-Seq molecular profile 

A substantial proportion of cancer cases present with a metastatic tumor and require further testing to determine the primary site; Many of these are never fully diagnosed and remain cancer of unknown primary origin. We hypothesized that higher accuracy could be achieved by using deep learning methods to:
  1. identify potential tissue of origin of unknown cancer types 

  2. predict tissue of origin of metastatic cancer by molecular profiles
